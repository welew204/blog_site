Title:   Soâ€¦ why â€˜Alchemyâ€™?

I always get a chuckle when I remember that the name of my business includes the word 'Alchemy'.

It conjures up images for me of Merlin the wizard, and dusty explosions coming out of medieval workshops and the like.

We originally chose it/found it thru the process of prime coffeeshop brain-jamming I was doing with my (then) business partner as we got started back in 2016.

But now days, I realize more and more often that 'alchemy' is so commonly used as a science-sounding filler-noun in the parts of the market/culture that some might identify as 'woo woo' (I hope I'm saying that right ðŸ˜œ).

And while I see the reasoning and importance of 'woo' in our world (I'll get to that more ðŸ‘‡), I also *very clearly* see and care about the parts of reality that 'woo' misses. Namely, that **there are observable, scientific certainties**; not *everything* is up for grabs and interpretation in the physical world.Even if our amazing human brains can think new things upâ€¦

Now don't get me wrongâ€¦ any scientist worth their salt will tell you that there is far more of the universe that we **don't** know about or understand than that we **do**. Like it ain't even close (some estimates put our actual understanding of just the extent of the *known physical universe* to be like 1%).*

But then again, even in cases where we don't know WHY something happens exactly (like gravity), we can count on that thing HAPPENING (like with gravity).

No matter your particular world view, I'd bet that you'd agree: there's a gap between observable, scientific realities (aka the 'evidence', or 'research', or 'scientific studies') and our actual understanding about WHY things are happening.

Extended into the human body, these gaps really come into focus, maybe because we have to also contend with our own subjective sense of ourselves.

We can observe certain changes over time, but at the same time know that by measuring and observing one thing (or a few things) we are *neccessarily* not seeing the whole organism (aka the PERSON). We can't it all in if we are focused on a few pieces.

So us trainersâ€”aka those (crazy?) people who believe that by *moving yourself* in certain, specific ways, you can actually change your physical reality by getting more coordinated, growing new tissue and expanding your endurance/capacityâ€”are choosing to face a funny challenge that is equal parts *science* and *magic.Or, Alchemy. *ðŸ˜ƒ

And the weirdest part? that's the best that any of us trainers (or PTs, Chiro's, massages therapists, mental health therapists, etc etc etc) we can doâ€”any of usâ€”to help you: **we can help guide you** (an unknowable WHOLE) **based on the specific details we DO know about the world generally** (aka the evidence, grounding, andâ€”hopefullyâ€”science). And, we can (try to) learn.

I'm curious â€¦ what does the word 'alchemy' bring up for you? Other than, ya know, *The Fitness Alchemists *ðŸ˜‰.

In your corner,
Coach Will

* This is where the 'woo' factor comes in for me, and seems really useful and even important: we *all* need to contend with the *fact* that there are parts of the universe, our experience, *everything* really, that we do not and will not ever understand. I think this capacity to NOT know things, and be ok with it, is sometimes called 'the ability to tolerate ambiguity,' or *wisdom*. And the wide world of 'woo' happens to offer a cornucopia of pathways to engaging with this deeply ancestral knowledge (somethings that is also sometimes referred to as *wisdom*).
