            <br />
            <p>Not sure if you saw this news tid-bit, but the US Senate is currently debating about confirming Deb Haaland as our new Secretary of the Interior.</p>
<p>(Coach Will here! Stay with this one, I promise it connects to your relations with your bod… read on!).</p>
<p>If confirmed, she would be the first Indigenous person to serve in this capacity; in fact, she's the first Indigenous person to be nominated to a cabinet position.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>When I was reading this about her last week, I suddenly was swept over by a wave of heavy emotion.</p>
<p>Here, for the first time in the 400+ years that Europeans (and their descendents) have arbitrarily laid claim to this continent, someone of Indeigenous descent is being lifted to power.</p>
<p>I can't point to what (literally) chokes me up each time I read about her, but there's something about what it means to have her <strong>voice </strong>and her <strong>life experiences</strong> ("I'm not a stranger to the struggles many families across America face today. I've lived most of my adult life paycheck to paycheck.") leading the decision-making about one of our most precious resources: <strong>land</strong>.</p>
<p>As in, <em>space</em>.</p>
<p>Room for beings to be. All of 'em/us.</p>
<p>More and more, I am seeing how <em>blocked </em>humans become--emotionally, physically, spiritually--when they don't have <strong>room </strong>to move and explore and rest and start over and, and, and... <em>be</em>. </p>
<p>In fact, many Indigenous activists have come to say that the <em>only </em>way to start healing the deep wounds caused by the Eurpoean genocide of Indigenous people is by literally returning ancestral land to tribes.</p>
<p>It's already happening, in East Oakland (and elsewhere).</p>
<p>This upswell of actual, tangible steps toward 're-matriation' of the land (and thereby starting the healing of cultural relationships as well) are inspiring to me.</p>
<p>My identity (white, able-bodied, cisgendered guy from the suburbs) makes it hard for me--emotionally--to fully face the reality of what my life represents next to the lives of my Ohlone neighbors.</p>
<p>But watching healing occur, led by Indigenous folx like Haaland, actually opens the door for me to see a glimpse of the living nightmare that ran on repeat for so many Indigenous people, for so many decades.</p>
<p>It's this emotional block--which limits our ability to fully face what is going on around us--that resonated most with me, and reminds me of my work teaching people the magic of mobility-training. </p>
<p>I recognized the powerful but often unseen force that keeps us from fully <em>seeing ourselves</em>. It's seldom about pure 'information' or knowledge that is the gap. </p>
<p>In my experience, it's much more about gradually softening toward ourselves, and allowing for the <em>idea </em>that we ALL. NEED. SPACE. To exist.</p>
<p>We need space in our schedule to <em>dream </em>and <em>do nothing</em>.</p>
<p>We need space in our ego to allow for bright, shining <em>achievements </em>and <em>failing</em>.</p>
<p>We need space in our kitchen for nourishing food of all types, including the tasty shit that doesn't serve any purpose beyond making us <em>happy</em>.</p>
<p>We need space in our clothes to hold all of our bulky, bony bits, and extra room to allow for dancing.</p>
<p>We need that as individuals, and our communities need that as well.</p>
<p>So whether we're <strong>'making space'</strong> in our joints, or in our schedules, relationships, or world-views, we can know that we are doing the very best thing for the overall system: <strong>allowing room for the magic to happen</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's to hoping that by the time you read this, Deb Haaland is overseeing that kind of transition for our country from the highest levels of our government.</p>
<p>Here's to finding your gold, </p>
<p>Coach Will</p>
