            <p>Coach Will here to say: I have absolutely no problem with making up new words. </p>
<p>No matter how ridiculous or nonsensical, the only criteria I maintain is that the listener must understand the word in context. If they do, you're good to go. (...and occasionally they look at you like you're stoned--be warned).</p>
<p>In fact, the process of making up "shared words" is that you create a little bridge of understanding around a specific, new thing.</p>
<p>That's exactly the kind of scaffolding that helps our brains form new memories, even while it releases a nice little hit of feel-good brain chemicals. It feels good to connect.</p>
<p>These are the simple, day-in/out interactions that effectively construct that magical thing called "community".</p>
<p>In our business, our effectiveness at building these emotional interactions is directly reflected with concrete numbers--hard evidence--likeâ€¦</p>
<p>More regular attendance in class</p>
<p>Improved performance on specific training metrics</p>
<p>Less injuries*</p>
<p>...and a bunch of "soft" evidence too, like the way someone seems more at ease, more settled, more able to be whoever they are when they're not <em>stressed-the-fck-out-all-the-time</em>.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this recently. After my initial consult call with a new client (F), I found myself re-organizing our usual introductory assessment and session plan to better suitâ€¦ <em>him</em>.</p>
<p>I realized how individualizing a program is as much about <em>actually interacting</em> with clients, asking questions and listening deeply, as it is about adjusting what you "have them do", especially at first (of course, they do all the <em>real </em>work...ðŸ’ª).</p>
<p>As a coach, taking the time to listen to people, to make as strong a connection with <strong>the person in front of you</strong> as you can, is so valuable, <em>for so many reasons</em>, that there's no real reason not to. You gotta do it.</p>
<p>And we all know what the alternative looks like. Call it "mansplaining" or "being an a<strong>hole", but the temptation for many of us (and let's be honest, especially men) to </strong>react as quickly as possible to solve the fcking problem** just, wellâ€¦ doesn't help that much.</p>
<p>Even as I made our intro material more specific to F, I shaped into a form that <em>he</em> would understand better, and not just giving him what we give everyone. Cuz he's not everyone. ðŸ™„</p>
<p>And I found myself using a new word: <strong>variousness</strong>...as in, what your joints need to effectively out-maneuver injurious positions. Usually we use the awesome word "Variability", which is the technical term for this quality that is magic for joint mobility.</p>
<p>It's all about building flexibility, and not necessarily in terms of how <em>far </em>you can stretch (your Range of Motion). Nope, it's actually <em>way</em> more important than that.</p>
<p>It's about the flexibility of your <em>approach</em>, how ready you are for the next, unknown thing. So when your joints have a whole menu of <em>various</em> movement options--and not just one, overused path--they can spread the load more evenly.</p>
<p>They're more variable. And armed with that variability, your body can <strong>learn how to </strong>do some <em>truly</em> amazing things.</p>
<p>But it starts with building the bridge of shared language, understanding, and trust, so that we're ready to learn from our environment and each other.</p>
<p>Go make up some new words ;),</p>
