<p>Writing a workout--any workout--is both a science and an art. Much like a recipe is designed to communicate the vast information needed for preparing a delicious dish, a written workout is intended to lay out the basics that one might need for a successful sweat session. Of course, just like recipes, the actual written information is just a starting point. Several different components can and should influence the final result.</p>
<p><em>Success</em>, in terms of exercise programming,Â is when that final result truly reflects the needs and wants of the person doing the actual workout(s). Oh, and you should finish feeling strong, mobile and "worked", too.</p>
<p>Here are the basic components to keep in mind as you set out to write your own workouts.</p>
<p>If writing and executing these "successful workouts" still seems daunting, then go ahead help yourself to one of the workouts found in this book. The more experience you have guiding yourself through workouts (even those written by us), the better you'll be at knowing what works <em>for you</em>Â and what kind of workouts <em>you</em>Â like to do.</p>
<p>Honestly, it's not the creation of the workout that's really the challenge. Instead, it's the awareness required to execute the workout well that determines people's true success, especially over the long-term. However, when circumstances require that you exercise on your own, or even come up with your own workouts, you simply must bring a higher degree of awareness and intention to your work, and <em>that</em>Â is the secret ingredient to finding long-term fitness success.</p>
