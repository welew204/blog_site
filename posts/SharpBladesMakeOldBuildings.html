            <p>There is an incredible carpentry tradition in Japan, founded largely upon creating structures and furniture with joints—where edges of wood come together—that don't use any nails, screws or glue.</p>
<p>Instead, they rely on and apply ancestral knowledge regarding the shape of strong connection points, and build incredibly stable structures largely by making very precise cuts, by hand.</p>
<p>Now |FNAME|, I wanted to to tell you about this today because it has a deep connection to how we can approach our bodies in a different, and I think better, way than main stream culture would have us do. This is a longer one, but it's been brewing for a while so…stick with me :).</p>
<p>In addition to being as effective, and sometimes <em>more</em> effective, as modern Western carpentry methods (using metal and glue), the result is stunningly beautiful.</p>
<p>I was first captivated by this art/craft/culture after college, when I found myself living in a small town on the Western brim of Massachusetts. It was as hot and humid that summer, and the only thing going in town was the library, where I stumbled upon the classic, 'The Art of Japanese Joinery'.</p>
<p>The 10yr-old in me flipped, and I fell into a deep and abiding fascination with how something so simple—essentially wooden blocks—could be assembled into everything from tiny, jewel-like boxes to sweeping temple roofs that have stood for 400 years, outlasting many more 'modern' buildings.</p>
<p>I learned about the guilds that had carefully cultivated these secrets.</p>
<p>I learned about the careful forestry and harvesting they did of the trees, so that the eventual structure built from a certain tree would actually become stronger, tighter, as it aged.</p>
<p>But I became most engaged by the tools of the trade.</p>
<p>See—foregoing modern materials wasn't the only way Japanese carpenters didn't conform; they also maintained an almost holy obsession with their simple, mechanical implements of their predecessors: handsaws, chisels, mallets and lines of string for marking straight lines.*</p>
<p>One night, as I randomly perused Japanese carpentry articles online, I finally read about what it was like to be a carpentry apprentice.</p>
<p>Here's how I remember it…</p>
<p>Apparently, at first, they just have you sweep the floor. For about 6 months. Very clean.</p>
<p>Then, they begin to teach you about sharpening the saws, some of which are 100+ years old. 100s of saw teeth. Sharp.</p>
<p>If you're still there after a couple years of sharpening saws, they'll graduate you up to the planes, and then finally the chisels which do much of the final joint-shaping. Make them Very Sharp.</p>
<p>After 5 years, they begin to teach you the way that you cut and shape wood into joints, and then it's several more years (like 10+) before becoming a master.</p>
<p>The more I learned, the more it became clear that the sharpening of knives was not just a tortuous initiation process to weed out casual hobbyists.</p>
<p>No, it functioned as an indoctrination into the essential, fundamental mind-set of a carpenter, and it informed everything they did.</p>
<p>After 5 or more years of simply sharpening tools, I imagine that one <em>must</em> come around to appreciating this subtle act.</p>
<p>They must form a connection with these precious, inanimate objects, and how to best conjure a sharp, cutting edge.</p>
<p>And then, as they learn how to wield them on the precious, natural gift that is a dead tree, these students of the steel realize that all their their dedication to sharpening is now coming back to them in the form of steady cuts and straight edges.</p>
<p>Over and over and over, steady cuts and straight edges.</p>
<p>No machines are needed when a master craftsman is wielding a sharp blade over a clean, hand-selected board.</p>
<p>Now for the analogy to our bodies that I have endlessly pondered since that sweaty Massachusetts summer… <strong>what is the valiant, daily act that we might do for ourselves that best compares to a carpenter sharpening their blades?</strong></p>
<p>What will not just make us sharper, but actually more capable of doing our craft and making our work?</p>
<p>What action/s will hone our bodies into the most true version of ourselves, the most effective and joyful version?</p>
<p>What beliefs will we need to hold onto, amidst all the bullshit swirling around, and what will we need to ignore?</p>
<p>And finally, what attitude will we take to our work, and what will our work inspire us to do <em>next</em>?</p>
<p>The underlying connection is that the work of our lives—be it "physical work" or just, you know, the fact our lives <em>occur </em>inside a PHYSICAL BODY—will always be the result of our ability to <em>use our tools</em>,</p>
<p>And the tools of "living in a body" are our joints. Our knees, and shoulders and all the rest.</p>
<p>That's right—in the world of movement, which is our world, our joints are the fundamental <em>way</em> that we get through. It is how we go toward the things we want, and go away from those we don't.</p>
<p>It's how we grow, and how we multiply.</p>
<p>Our joints are the carpenter's chisel, our saw, that we use to construct the work of our dreams: our lives.</p>
<p>This is why I am so adamant about spending the little time that we each day to move—at least some of it—on "sharpening" our joints, on making our 'movement-parts' work a little better.</p>
<p>What would you make with joints that cut a straighter path to where you wanted to go?</p>

<p>Ps: If you're curious about what a 'Daily Sharpen' might look like for you, reply to this email with SHARP in the subject line and l'll send you a Kinstretch class to try out. <em>You gotta feel it to believe it…</em></p>
<p>*No power saws, no drill presses, and most of the work was done on the ground. I know—WHAT?!</p>
