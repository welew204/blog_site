            <br />
            <p>Morning! Coach Will here ðŸ‘‹.</p>
<p>Last week I wrote about the importance of having functional joints. If you missed it, <strong>click </strong><strong>here</strong><strong> </strong>to read it over--I think it's about as clear as I've ever been able to describe it. </p>
<p>You should read <em>this</em> email too--all the way to the endâ€¦ there's an announcement of sorts :). </p>
<p>Anyway, getting back to having functional jointsâ€¦</p>
<p>Unfortunately for us, modern life has stacked a few imposing obstacles in our path toward achieving this simple yet worthy goal (i.e. <em>joints that â€¦ work</em>). </p>
<p>First, a <strong>lack-of-movement pandemic</strong> has quite suddenly (in the grand scheme of time) taken hold of huge number of us humans. Our lives, centered around a healthy baseline of physical activity (aka "mechanical inputs") even just 50-100 years ago, increasingly demand nothing more physical from us than staring at a screen, typing on a keyboard, and pushing down a gas pedal. </p>
<p>This means that all of our joints are <strong>literally starved</strong> of the mechanical inputs so necessary for normal tissue regulation and maintenance, not to mention building that invaluable brain-map that we will call on when we <em>do</em> start moving. </p>
<p>Which brings us to a second major obstacle: the movement options ("workouts") that the fitness industry currently provides as stand-ins for these necessary inputs are usually <em>not suited for the development of functional joints</em>. </p>
<p>In the best cases, these workouts develop semi-functional joints as a lucky by-product of some other goal (see the third bullet below for more on the insidious quality of a competitive culture), but quite often with significant <strong>blind spots</strong> that often materialize as injury for the mover down the road. In the worst cases, these workouts literally cause injury. </p>
<p>Our third, perhaps most insidious, obstacle to functional bodies is the way that society has told us to measure ourselves. Somewhere along the line, we were told that simply <em>functioning well</em> was not enough. No--we needed to be a specific size, or color, or socio-economic status, or â€¦ or â€¦</p>
<p>What I'm really talking about are the unseen but omnipresent forces that shape all of us, all the time: <strong>status</strong> (wealth/poverty), <strong>xenophobia</strong> (fear of others), <strong>misogyny</strong>, <strong>racism</strong>, <strong>shame</strong>, and the rest. If nothing else, I believe we should all start by being <em>aware</em> of these forces. Â And then work to eradicate them--as much as that is possible given our deeply primate brains. </p>
<p>As coaches, we see people getting stuck by each of these obstacles <strong>all the time</strong>. So as a company that wants to make things better, we need to look at how to guide our students who are working around/through/with one or more of these challenges. Â </p>
<p>We do that by focusing on the coach-student interaction--the right group size, the right program/plan, the right focus (on joints!), the right assessment, the right coaching approach, and the right learning environment. Each of these components, combined together as thoughtfully as possible, have a <em>chance</em> at effectively shaping someone's outcome. </p>
<p>These past two newsletters (from me) have been a long-way round of saying something simple: </p>
<p>We stand by that mission because we can clearly see--in the physical movement and actual reports from our long-term students--the effect of having functional joints on the quality of your life.</p>
<p>Our business has continuously angled toward forwarding this simple mission, and sometimes things <em>jump </em>forward. In that spirit, next week we have some big news to share... </p>
<p>Until then, </p>
<p>Coach Will</p>
