            <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>What if you were <em>able</em> to believe that already, right now, you are <em>doing it right</em>?</p>
<p>What if you were able to be generous with yourself, and see the glass of your experience as half-full?</p>
<p>What if the paths you see for yourself to PROGRESS or GROW were just <em>options</em> in front of a <strong>you</strong> that was <em>already</em> doing a great job?</p>
<p>How would that shift your relationship with yourself?</p>
<p>How would that relieve the constant barrage of 'SHOULD's and 'YEAH, BUT's that undercut you?</p>
<p>How would that expand your world-view, and the moves you could make in that expanse?</p>
<p>Now, this kind of thought experiment isn't some kind of believe-it-into-reality ploy, but rather just an idea to play with, and maybe to balance out the chorus of dissent that can dominate our inner worlds.</p>
<p>I remember so clearly walking to class in college and realizing how loud the "You SHOULD‚Ä¶" voices really were in my head.</p>
<p>And I say 'voices' because there were <em>several</em>, and they were arguing.¬† Their messages conflicted, intertwining into so many dead-ends, and I was stuck in the middle trying to figure out what to do.</p>
<p>It really felt like no matter what direction I took, I'd be 'doing it wrong' according to at least one of those "SHOULD-y" voices.</p>
<p>And just like that, like a circuit shorting itself, I would be drained and confused simply by trying to satisfy all those critical voices.</p>
<p>Now some years on from that realization, I still hear those voices all the times (yes, I hear voices üò¨), but they've been balanced out with other voices, that sound/feel more like <em>gratitude </em>(I attribute this change mostly to a long-term commitment I have to recognizing the good stuff in my life)</p>
<p>The reality is that our lives, our bodies, our <em>being</em> is replete with natural miracles, miracles of sensation, of connection, of consciousness, of possibility and transformation.</p>
<p>Our minds, on the other hand, can sometimes stagnate with an underlying belief that we are NOT doing it right.</p>
<p>But what if, just for a moment, you were able to believe that actually, right now ... you are doing it right?</p>
<p>Where would <em>that</em> inner conversation lead‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>Here's to finding your gold üçª,</p>
<p>Coach Will</p>
