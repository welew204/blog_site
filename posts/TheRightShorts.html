            <h2>The Right Shorts</h2>
            <h3>Will Belew</h3>

            <br />
            <p>For how much I now love to ride my bike, I will never forget the laughably simple thing that unlocked this love in me: <em>having the right clothes</em>.</p>
<p>Now why am I telling you about probably the least cool-looking part of my wardrobe? Because nested inside this experience is an important lesson, and one that could help you, too. Read on…</p>
<p>I had ridden my bike on and off since I was a kid, but my interest would inevitably wane as I confronted the limits of my endurance. Basically, after a few longer rides, I'd grasp how consistent I'd need to be with my training to really move to another level, where longer rides felt doable and fun.</p>
<p>And I'd stop.</p>
<p>But then my old buddy Max came by for a ride, and we got to chatting. He's always been a serious cyclist, and as a semi-pro had more cycling clothing ('kits' in biker parlance) than he could use. So he sent me some.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, as I unboxed the random assortment of padded shorts and slinky jerseys it dawned on me how much my biking efforts in the past were limited <em>simply</em> by the fact that I'd run out of the right gear.</p>
<p>I'd go for a few rides and then <em>run out of clean clothes.</em> And that would be enough to knock me off my momentum.</p>
<p>It feels ridiculous to write, but if you've ever ridden for more than a half-hour on a bike seat <em>you KNOW </em>how much a difference the right shorts make. Without them, your nethers immediately start barking at you; <em>with</em> them you don't even think about your seat until long after everything else has gotten good and tired.</p>
<p>Since receiving that shipment of bike clothes about 16 months ago, I have ridden my bike nearly 7,500 miles. Suffice to say, I've been able to keep my biking momentum…</p>
<p><strong>And herein is the lesson: sometimes the most basic-seeming change can unblock you in ways you never imagined.</strong></p>
<p>Now let's be honest: <em>most</em> of the time, getting new clothes won't prompt a big change in behavior. But the <em>right </em>new thing—be it equipment, or a routine, or information—at the right time can completely change the challenge you're facing.</p>
<p>There's the you BEFORE the <em>something</em>, and the you AFTER it, and they're distinctly, definitely <em>changed</em> in some powerful way.</p>
<p>I'd guess this happens most often with the right <em>information</em>: getting a key shred of info at the right time, when you're <em>ready</em> for it, can unlock you in a way that will never stop feeling miraculous.</p>
<p>In that spirit, I want to<strong> </strong>leave you with an ask: <strong>what do you MOST want to know about mobility, or training, or fitness?</strong></p>
<p>I'd love to address your questions in upcoming newsletters, and maybe—just <em>maybe—</em>it will prove to be that key for you that changes everything…</p>
<p>In your corner,
Coach Will</p>
