            <h2>Panning for Gratitude</h2>
            <h3>Will Belew</h3>
            <h3>Tue, May 21 2019</h3>
            <br />
            <p>Like many of us, my greatest strength is also a pain-in-the-ass weakness. (Coach Will here.)</p>
<p><strong>I tend to over-extrapolate.</strong></p>
<p>Over-generalize. Over-connect. Try to draw big lessons from minor blips. Also: look for a meaningful signal amidst all the noise.</p>
<p>When it's acting as a strength, this tendency helps me see the forest made up of so many trees. It helps me hypothesize about causes, so I might test them out, and it generates intentional strategies that guide my action. I see the chess-board 5 moves ahead.</p>
<p>But as a weakness, this kind of connection/implication overdrive has me drawing conclusions from nothing, really. A small comment or minor observation will convince me of things that, no matter how exciting or important-feeling, are <em>just not true</em>.</p>
<p>I get so excited--so <em>enthusiastic--to</em> connect ideas and meanings that I readily suspend my disbelief and build all kinds of phantasmagorical notions. When it works, I can "see" what is not obvious; but when it doesn't, I find myself a mile down a road that doesn't matter, going nowhere.</p>
<p>This dynamic is part of me, the good and the bad. For every chess trophy it helped me win as a kid, it has kept me up a dozen sleepless night, spinning insomniac anxiety-fantasies in my head.</p>
<p>But only recently have I begun to see the real issue with this powerful skill: <strong>having this kind of lens on the world ignores so much</strong>.</p>
<p>Continuously zooming out means that I miss some important details, even as I get hung up on meaningless ones. And no matter how effective I get at discerning the difference, jumping from conclusion to conclusion denies maybe the best part of life: <em>feeling grateful</em>.</p>
<p>Which leads me to realize … <strong>When I'm struggling, gratitude is often the answer for me</strong>.</p>
<p>And only recently have I realized that true gratitude is a vulnerable feeling for me, because it means returning to a mind-set from childhood: un<strong>adult</strong>erated joy, that spontaneous, creative and not-intended-to-be-shared gladness for life.</p>
<p>It's an inside feeling, an intimate feeling. And one that changes when it is <em>for</em> others.</p>
<p>It's a feeling that has you seeing the world with caring detail, and being generous with your attention to <em>what's really going on.</em> In these moments I'm reminded, with relief, that "Right now is enough."</p>
<p>Ahh, <em>sigh.</em></p>
<p>Long, steady exercise puts me right there.</p>
<p>Which is how I found myself half-way up Mt. Tam last month, astride my bicycle, laughing at how outrageous the tiny wild-flowers were, growing right out the side of the rock face, shaking furiously in the wind and telling the fog to f*ck off with their bright whites and purples and yellows.</p>
<p>A voice inside shouted: <em>Will, wait! Capture this moment! Share with all the people who might need a reminder of beauty in the world!</em></p>
<p>This voice came from the zoom-out instinct. The Extrapolator. <em>Tie in everything with everything!</em></p>
<p>But then another voice answered: <em>Right now is enough. Take it in, fully. Make a memory. Cherish it. Let it make your life a little better. Share if you care to, later.</em></p>
<p>And before I knew it, I was 100 feet up the road, too slow with my camera but steady with my gaze.</p>
<p>Grateful for sweat and redwoods, water and almonds, for the biting cold and the blue sky peaking just over the ridge.</p>
<p>This is how I'm untying my own knots, these days. How I'm doing "my work".</p>
<p>Because amidst all the stress and strain, whatever that looks like for each of us, there are corners in our lives where the magic-dust collects. It hides in the crevices, in the nooks where we don't think to look.</p>
<p><strong>We must pan for that gold.</strong></p>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
