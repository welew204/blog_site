            <h2>Strength Is a Many-Splendored Thing</h2>
            <h3>Will Belew</h3>

            <br />
            <p>Last weekend, I sniffed the air and decided: it was time to plant the spring seedlings.</p>
<p>It's something I really love to do, gardening nerd that I am (Coach Will here).</p>
<p>I took a distinctly unplanned approach this year, and just bought a bunch of happy little sprout-lets to fill in the gaps in my raised beds.</p>
<p>(I'm calling it the 'We'll see!' strategy, which feels much less weight-y than the detailed plans I've drawn up in other years.)</p>
<p>Anyway, as I finished up transplanting the last of the tiny basil plants, I suddenly noticed how delicately I was handling these fresh young herbs. I supported them so gently, barely grasping them at all, in fear of crushing their intensely fine roots or bruising their bright green stalks.</p>
<p>As I finished up and patted the dirt around those same stalks, now jutting confidently out of the ground, I caught a whiff of their incredible perfume. All at once the vibrancy of late summer flashed through my brain, when they will be bush-like and laden with jewels of green leaves.</p>
<p>The power of the smell, the <em>strength </em>of it, caught me off-guard. I wasn't prepared for this sudden reminder of basil's essential, incredible part of my remembered life story.</p>
<p>And that's how it is with <strong>strength</strong>, something I tend to think a lot about…</p>
<p>The word--"strength"--tends to be thrown around like we all know <em>exactly</em> what it is. But in reality, it is many, many things.</p>
<p>It can be the strength to lift hundreds of pounds from the ground up over your head. </p>
<p>It can be the strength to <em>keep going</em> for hours, days, or decades.</p>
<p>It can be the strength to tell the asshole to go away, or to leave the asshole behind.</p>
<p>And it can be the strength of a single whiff of a tiny basil plant, strong enough to evoke powerful memories.</p>
<p>Because strength as a concept is <em>not</em> about the measured size of the force, but about the <em>impact</em> of that force.</p>
<p>This is why I wanted to write to you today.</p>
<p>It's so easy to slip into a binary world--of right/wrong, strong/weak, able/disabled--and that arbitrary distinction does not serve any of us, actually.</p>
<p>It only serves to make the world <em>easier</em> to think about, but doesn't bring us closer to reality.</p>
<p>So while Hannah and I are excited, delighted even, whenever we get to work with people on getting <em>stronger</em>, we also see that 'stronger' as …. <em>not</em> just one thing.</p>
<p>Instead, <em>stronger</em> is the way that person can become more effective at being <em>themselves</em>, and their strength will be as unique as their fingerprint.</p>
<p>Because strength is a many-splendored thing.</p>
<p>Here's to finding your gold,</p>
<p>Coach Will</p>
