            <h2>The Mystery of Energy</h2>

            <br />
            <p>Someone on some podcast I was listening to (Coach Will here, btw) mentioned Richard Feynman recently. It was the 80th time for me (and I still hadn't read anything by the Nobel-prize winning physicist), so I picked up a short sampling of his lectures called Six Easy Pieces.</p>
<p>The title is a joke, because the book is 6 essays on the <em>hardest damn ideas known to man</em>. Things like gravity, and energy, and quantumâ€¦ stuff.</p>
<p><strong>But it's ok.</strong> In Feynman's words, anyone who says they understand quantum physics <em>doesn't understand quantum physics </em>(it's...unknowable, currently. I guess. Shrug).</p>
<p>After all, there's value in <em>not</em> knowing things, too. In knowing what you don't know, and generally knowing what it is to be ignorant.</p>
<p>Which leads me to one of the sentences in the slim volume that has stuck with me, gnawed at me: <strong>we don't really know what energy is</strong>.</p>
<p>We all know what energy feels ("push", force, heat) and looks like (light). And the first law of thermodynamics tells us that there's a conservation in energy--it must come from and go somewhere, but new energy is never <em>created</em>.</p>
<p>But we also realize, in some sense, that energy is unknowable. For example: where does it come from? It is the water the fish swims in, the medium of our lives, so ubiquitous that it disappears to us.</p>
<p>As Feynman explains, we only know how to measure the energy of a system before and after tiny "events". Using lots of math we can prove that all of the energy was accounted for between our measurements. But we certainly don't (currently) have a way of <em>seeing</em> energy as it moves.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Well--it seems that the world, at its tiny-est scales, operates between the cracks of our awareness. We're left trying to grasp (guessing, literally, via probabilities) where and when energy <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>I was out of my depth in the physics realm from page one of reading, but what <em>I </em>saw Feynman talking about is something I'm more familiar with: how even as it can't quite be observed explicitly, energy is apparent to us, intimately..</p>
<p>See, while we can't capture energy itself, exactly, we can trace its literal path through us.</p>
<p><strong>DO THIS: </strong>Lean your head over to the side, feel a stretch on the opening side of your neck. That's a line of tension, formed through a regular, recurrent pattern of loading (in this case, the force involved with hanging your shoulder from your ear). <strong>You just felt the evidence of energy moving through the system of your neck.</strong></p>
<p>Each force (energy) our bodies experience is absorbed and dispersed by the masses of tissue that make us up. So even while we can't really perceive energy exactly, we have a deep awareness of it all the same.</p>
<p>Consistently applied forces with enough zeal behind them to actually demand a response from your tissue signal your cells to go to work--to adapt your body--in response to the stressor. And that tissue? It will now be changed, characterized by an increased resilience to exactly the forces that kicked off the adaptation in the first place.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we are only as <em>capable</em> in our various ventures as our tissue is <em>able</em> to absorb and disperse forces--without, that is, going <em>bang</em> (or pop, rip, tear, crunch, etc) and manifesting as an injury. More than any other single physical purpose, our bodies indicate that <strong>we are purpose-built for energy-dispersal, in all its many forms.</strong></p>
<p>In this way, we know exactly what energy is.</p>
<p>We can feel it, and we bear evidence of it's constant march all around, and indeed <em>through</em>, us. And we can direct it, as movement (and therefore, vibration, expression, conversation, art, performance, speed, etc, etc). <strong>But more on that another time</strong>.</p>
<p>Go disperse some energy (and find your gold),</p>
