Recently I had a long-term student tell me that they had finally  learned  what FRC and Kinstretch is, and they learned about it by Googling   it. Meaning, the deepest underpinnings of our training approach (over the last 2-3 years, at least), had been obscured for her. Once this student (again, by  Googling  üòÇ)  saw  these fundamentals, she much more clearly understood why we had structured our new training program as we have. On the one hand: Woo! She got it! On the other: why hadn‚Äôt  we  taught these lessons clearly enough? Why did she need Google? That lack of clarity meant she was spot on when she continued: ‚ÄúYou guys could have done a better job with onboarding.‚Äù Yes, we could have. After I got over the shock of my failure as her teacher (#truthhurts), I started thinking about how we could be more clear about what we do. So it is in the spirit of illumination--for our current students and as an introduction to some newbies on this newsletter--that I want to tell you about  what we, The Fitness Alchemists, do ... We are interested in exploring how a clear, coherent  physical  signal in someone‚Äôs life might help them become more of who  they  are, more of  themselves . While we are certainly in the business of physical training (and therefore under the fitness umbrella), our training looks a lot different than most of what you see in the media. To put it simply, we prioritize  the independence of your joints  over all else. We make the quality, quantity and  sophistication  of your back, shoulders, hips, and toes (and all the rest :)  our number one goal . We take this approach because of what we‚Äôve learned from the Functional Range Conditioning-- FRC fer short --framework. FRC is known as much for its seemingly off-the-wall exercises all over social media (like CARs üöò aka Controlled Articular Rotations, and tons of isometrics) as for its association with the  creme de la creme  of professional sports (literally, almost all major sports teams/organizations use FRC directly with their athletes). Kinstretch is the group-class application of these concepts. But hidden inside this trendy-feeling system is a well of scientific truths, mined meticulously by a bunch of sweethearts from Canada, that give evidence of what has been  measured, observed, and quantified  (aka Science) in regards to our joints. This kind of firm, researched backstop provided us with clarity about what we see our students  need  in their lives. After almost two decades of shared experience, we (Hannah and I) concluded that the number one obstacle for the humans under our guidance was the quality of their joints. Movement generally was nearly the best thing for a human‚Äôs physical health, but in most cases of inactivity there was one (or more) major joint limitations that were directly prohibiting movement. On the other hand, given sufficient  joint quality  (which we define essentially as  joints that have the   adequate range of motion and conditioning to match the needs of their lives ), people could do whatever they wanted. I‚Äôm serious. The difference was stark. Assuming there is room to operate (i.e. enough ‚Äúactive‚Äù soft tissue holding enough  space  between your bones), movement is easy, fluid, and available. But without that space? Well, we‚Äôre f</em>ckt. Essentially, joints hate to be confined. Without movement,  USE , and the accompanying flow of nutrients, our ability to  feel  our joints starts to die, which slowly makes us blind to our ability to contract in those zones. That ‚Äúblindness‚Äù leads to muscle atrophy, which leads to a loss in energy as your metabolic rate drops. Everything becomes harder, life stiffens up. Fortunately for us humans, that tune can be played backwards, too*. When people start with us, they usually need to realize that they even  have  joints. Yup, as in... Oh, that ole shoulder blade? It moves?! Whoaaa‚Ä¶ Then, they need to feel the slightly-odd (because it‚Äôs  new ) sensation of  being strong  in new places: deep stretches, fatiguing isometrics, and a veritable tour of (muscle) Cramp City. And then they need to just do it. As in‚Ä¶ SHOW UP... ...to class. ...to learn. ...and most importantly, for  yourself.  I‚Äôll say it again:  Show up for yourself. Listen to your body, and your feelings, and thoughts.  Go to a class, do CARs at home, learn about your body, by feel, one joint at a time, and patiently witness your body become more resilient, capable, and tuned-in. In my experience...with that awareness comes curiosity, which brings joy, and wisdom. As a teacher, I am continuously swept away with my curiosity about what each of us can/could do,  given sufficient freedom and information to find sufficient joint space . Because when we do, we can be  ourselves , just  more . And that is  always  a beautiful, human thing. Go find your gold, Coach Will * I love me some backwards music .</p>
