            <br />
            <p>Recently I had a long-term student tell me that they had finally <em>learned </em>what FRC and Kinstretch is, and they learned about it by Googling<em> </em>it.</p>
<p>Meaning, the deepest underpinnings of our training approach (over the last 2-3 years, at least), had been obscured for her.</p>
<p>Once this student (again, by <em>Googling</em> ðŸ˜‚) <em>saw</em> these fundamentals, she much more clearly understood why we had structured our new training program as we have.</p>
<p>On the one hand: Woo! She got it! On the other: why hadn't <em>we</em> taught these lessons clearly enough? Why did she need Google?</p>
<p>That lack of clarity meant she was spot on when she continued: "You guys could have done a better job with onboarding."</p>
<p>Yes, we could have.</p>
<p>After I got over the shock of my failure as her teacher (#truthhurts), I started thinking about how we could be more clear about what we do.</p>
<p>So it is in the spirit of illumination--for our current students and as an introduction to some newbies on this newsletter--that I want to tell you about <strong>what we, The Fitness Alchemists, do</strong>...</p>
<p>We are interested in exploring how a clear, coherent <strong>physical </strong>signal in someone's life might help them become more of who <strong>they </strong>are, more of <strong>themselves</strong>.</p>
<p>While we are certainly in the business of physical training (and therefore under the fitness umbrella), our training looks a lot different than most of what you see in the media.</p>
<p>To put it simply, we prioritize <strong>the independence of your joints</strong> over all else. We make the quality, quantity and <em>sophistication</em> of your back, shoulders, hips, and toes (and all the rest :) our number one goal.</p>
<p>We take this approach because of what we've learned from the Functional Range Conditioning-- FRC fer short --framework. FRC is known as much for its seemingly off-the-wall exercises all over social media (like CARs ðŸš˜ aka Controlled Articular Rotations, and tons of isometrics) as for its association with the <em>creme de la creme</em> of professional sports (literally, almost all major sports teams/organizations use FRC directly with their athletes). Kinstretch is the group-class application of these concepts.</p>
<p>But hidden inside this trendy-feeling system is a well of scientific truths, mined meticulously by a bunch of sweethearts from Canada, that give evidence of what has been <strong>measured, observed, and quantified </strong>(aka Science) in regards to our joints.</p>
<p>This kind of firm, researched backstop provided us with clarity about what we see our students <em>need</em> in their lives.</p>
<p>After almost two decades of shared experience, we (Hannah and I) concluded that the number one obstacle for the humans under our guidance was the quality of their joints.</p>
<p>Movement generally was nearly the best thing for a human's physical health, but in most cases of inactivity there was one (or more) major joint limitations that were directly prohibiting movement.</p>
<p>On the other hand, given sufficient <strong>joint quality</strong> (which we define essentially as <em>joints that have the</em> <em>adequate range of motion and conditioning to match the needs of their lives</em>), people could do whatever they wanted.</p>
<p>I'm serious. The difference was stark.</p>
<p>Assuming there is room to operate (i.e. enough "active" soft tissue holding enough <em>space</em> between your bones), movement is easy, fluid, and available.</p>
<p>But without that space? Well, we're f*ckt.</p>
<p>Essentially, joints hate to be confined. Without movement, <strong>USE</strong>, and the accompanying flow of nutrients, our ability to <em>feel</em> our joints starts to die, which slowly makes us blind to our ability to contract in those zones.</p>
<p>That "blindness" leads to muscle atrophy, which leads to a loss in energy as your metabolic rate drops. Everything becomes harder, life stiffens up.</p>
<p><strong>Fortunately for us humans, that tune can be played backwards, too*.</strong></p>
<p>When people start with us, they usually need to realize that they even <em>have</em> joints. Yup, as in... Oh, that ole shoulder blade? It moves?! Whoaaaâ€¦</p>
<p>Then, they need to feel the slightly-odd (because it's <strong>new</strong>) sensation of <em>being strong</em> in new places: deep stretches, fatiguing isometrics, and a veritable tour of (muscle) Cramp City.</p>
<p>And then they need to just do it.</p>
<p>As inâ€¦ SHOW UP...</p>
<p>...to class.</p>
<p>...to learn.</p>
<p>...and most importantly, for *yourself.Â *</p>
<p>I'll say it again: <em>Show up for yourself.</em></p>
<p>Listen to your body, and your feelings, and thoughts.Â </p>
<p>Go to a class, do CARs at home, learn about your body, by feel, one joint at a time, and patiently witness your body become more resilient, capable, and tuned-in.</p>
<p>In my experience...with that awareness comes curiosity, which brings joy, and wisdom.</p>
<p>As a teacher, I am continuously swept away with my curiosity about what each of us can/could do, <strong>given sufficient freedom and information to find sufficient joint space</strong>.</p>
<p>Because when we do, we can be <strong>ourselves, just more.</strong></p>
<p>And that is <em>always</em> a beautiful, human thing.</p>
<p>Go find your gold,</p>
<p>Coach Will</p>
<p>*I love me some backwards music.</p>
