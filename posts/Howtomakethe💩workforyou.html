Heya, it's Coach Will checking in.  As I watch the Covid-19 pandemic phenomenon unravel, I keep feeling as if I am witnessing a slow motion (and collective) car accident. Itâ€™s been utterly disorienting to watch as the tiniest of creatures (a virus) gashes a vast wound--physical and social and economic--across our world. And while I can grasp the stages of recovery involved with healing (or integrating) trauma, I canâ€™t yet know how to deal with this one. None of us can, for one reason:  itâ€™s not over yet .  We are all suspended in time, oriented only by the fact that we are definitely living in  the time of Covid . And while we can can comprehend the beginning of this epoch, and we are starting to understand the power of simply living for right now ('cuz that's the only option), none of us can say for sure what comes next, even a little bit. But along with everything that's been forced to change, Iâ€™ve also begun to notice something subtle going on with our clients, something I hadnâ€™t expected.  And something that is distinctly positive .  When we used to train people in person--aka  The Time Before Covid --Hannah and I talked a ton about how to  cajole  our peeps into simply  doing the thing . We knew that we had valuable skills to teach them, and that if they showed up some magical things could happen to their bodies, but we kept running into the need to  convince  folks to come train. To  inspire  without coercion, to invite without the guilt-trip. And that on-going motivating was, and is, an important role. Sometimes, coaches need to be motivators, plain and simple.  But I also couldnâ€™t help but thinkâ€¦ the energy that a coach can lend will  never  approach the fire of someone who is  intrinsically  motivated, someone who is curious and dedicated to exploring one simple question: "W hat does it feel like to realize  my  potential?" Which brings me back to what Iâ€™m starting to see blossom in this post-Covid era, even through the narrow communication channels that our new, mostly-digital lives offer... By taking away most of the prompts and prods that we used to be able to offer (eg: classes that you had to sign up and show up for, the energy boost of teammates, the in-the-moment encouragement of coaches, etc), clients have only one person to depend on  if  they are going to train at all:  themselves .  Ironically, this is how it always was...but perhaps it was never quite this clear. The choice to train, to work on your weaknesses and limitations so that you can be stronger and more effective in the future, has always been yours and only yours to make. It's just that our previous "normal" lives  used  to offer a wide array of distractions from this truth. But with Covid...those stories no longer apply.  With so much stripped away, it's just you and the  choice to move , in an epic, daily showdown.  Now donâ€™t misread me here: Iâ€™m the first to despair at the temporary loss of in-person connection that our classes and training sessions offered, and I have quite a bit to lose personally if this whole thing continues to careen out of control for much longer.  But that doesnâ€™t change the powerful stirrings of inner drive that Iâ€™m noticing in our clients . Iâ€™m seeing it in their steadily increasing rates of completing workouts (on TrueCoach, our training app) and in their voices during coaching calls. And Iâ€™m really noticing it in their texted comments and questions; itâ€™s clear that theyâ€™re engaged and intentional and really grabbing on their  own  experience. Theyâ€™re   showing up for themselves  in a way that was simply beyond reach for many of them  before  Covid. And while as a coach I  can  motivate folks, I  live  to light the inner fires that burn much longer for my students than just one workout, one training cycle, or hell, even one pandemic. And I'm seeing some inner fires starting burn  bright . Have you noticed stirrings of this more  positive  kind in  your  response to the stress you're facing these days? Have you noticed a shift in your  Whyâ€™s  for doing things? Or a change in your  expectations ? ( Remember , lowered expectations can often mean easier short-term wins that you can then build on .) Have you found yourself, maybe against major inner resistance and lack of any sort of  drive , digging into the projects or obstacles of your life, and been surprised not  only  by the fact that you have any energy at all, but actually that your efforts feel more  real,  or  grounded,  or in alignment with your values, then before? Iâ€™d love to hear about it. Seriously, hit reply and tell me how these times have shifted your inner perspective on doing the hard stuff.  Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s inspiring as hell,  even if you donâ€™t think so  (itâ€™s often hardest to see our own heroism).  One more thing: while Iâ€™m stoked to see these threads of gold running through the heart-breaking reality that weâ€™re all watching--and feeling--unfold out right now, that doesnâ€™t undermine the fact that another perfectly normal response is plain ole grief.  I believe that tears--real ones and the inner, hidden storm clouds--are the rain that water the little seedlings of our inner lives. We donâ€™t get to grow without being vulnerable, and vulnerability means that we sometimes get hurt.  So if all youâ€™re feeling is hurt, thatâ€™s ok too ( hereâ€™s a good number to call if youâ€™re having trouble navigating this hurt : 1-800-662-HELP (4357)). Either way -- I hope you keep digging away, letting the  bounce off, but holding on tight to the gold that you find. Go be your own hero,  Coach Will</p>
