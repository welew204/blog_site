            <h2>How Fatphobia Distorts the World</h2>
            <h3>Will Belew</h3>
            <h3>Tue, Feb 08 2022</h3>
            <br />
            <p>I'm feeling fiery today, and it's because I know that there are people out in the world (maybe you?) who are feeling blocked in their ability to enjoy <em>movement </em>because of that scabby scourge that is <strong>fatphobia</strong>.</p>
<p>And that's counter to my mission, of bringing people back to <em>their</em> movement joy practice ('cuz we all had one when we were 4, ya know??).</p>
<p>Now, the more I learn about bodies—and you KNOW how much I like to learn— the more clearly I see all the ways that fatphobia (and it's colleagues in <strong>bullsh*t</strong> called able-ism, health-ism, race-ism and all the other -isms) make the work of 'training' (aka <em>guiding your body to feel better and do more</em>) much, much harder.</p>
<p>Again and again, fatphobia stands in the way of our individual AND collective progress.</p>
<p>On the one hand, fatphobia contributes to the daily subjugation of people who have visible body-fat on their bodies.</p>
<p>As Lindy West first (in my world) pointed out, anti-fat bias is one of the last socially acceptable ways to discriminate against people publicly and directly to their face (not to mention behind their back, too).</p>
<p>And yet health practitioners, from massage therapists and personal trainers to doctors and psychiatrists, <strong>routinely</strong> focus on a person's weight (or worse, their BMI, a useless sham of a statistic) to bully them into behavior change. (When has bullying ever worked? As in long-term, measurable change that DIDN'T come with terrible side-effects?)</p>
<p>This kind of systematic bias causes pain and suffering, inside and out; in my opinion, it is a form of violence.</p>
<p>This, of course, props up the social/cultural pressures that point to <em>one</em> body shape as 'the right one', and cast the others aside.</p>
<p>And this message leaks into <em>all</em> of our psyches, whether we look 'fat' or not. Raise your hand if you have 'felt fat' no matter how you look, or what other people say about your body?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>raises hand&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>In fact, I spent a solid portion of my teens and twenties obsessing about my food intake, over-exercising, and rapidly fluctuating my weight. I didn't "look like" I had an eating disorder (which is not something you <em>can</em> see, anyway), but if it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck…</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I got the message, and started moving away from this harmful way of seeing and treating my body. </p>
<p>And I am happy to see that the word <em>is</em> starting to get out into the broader meme-o-sphere, as well, and the 'word' is this: <strong>fatphobia isn't based on scientific reality</strong>.</p>
<p>Body fat is not a signifier of health, let alone <em>morality</em>, and any guidance that puts the LOSS of body fat as a goal above all the other ways that someone might make their body and world a better, safer, place to be, is downright negligent.</p>
<p><strong>Humans come in different sizes.</strong> Period.</p>
<p>Only when a critical mass of people in the world see that fact as <em>fact</em> can we let (all) humans be humans—magnificent, imperfect, creative, communal, energetic, sluggish, allll of it—and get down to the real business of saving ourselves, each other, and our world.</p>
<p>And if you're curious to learn a bit more, I can <em>highly</em> recommend subscribing to Virgie Tovar's Body Positive University as a friendly (and fiendishly smart) guide into this way of seeing ourselves and the culture we all swim in. I look forward to reading her emails evvvverytime.</p>
<p>That's all for now!</p>
<p>In your corner,
Will</p>
