            <h2>Soâ€¦ why â€˜Alchemyâ€™?</h2>
            <h3>Will Belew</h3>

            <br />
            <p>I always get a chuckle when I remember that the name of my business includes the word 'Alchemy'.</p>
<p>It conjures up images for me of Merlin the wizard, and dusty explosions coming out of medieval workshops and the like.</p>
<p>We originally chose it/found it thru the process of prime coffeeshop brain-jamming I was doing with my (then) business partner as we got started back in 2016.</p>
<p>But now days, I realize more and more often that 'alchemy' is so commonly used as a science-sounding filler-noun in the parts of the market/culture that some might identify as 'woo woo' (I hope I'm saying that right ðŸ˜œ).</p>
<p>And while I see the reasoning and importance of 'woo' in our world (I'll get to that more ðŸ‘‡), I also <em>very clearly</em> see and care about the parts of reality that 'woo' misses. Namely, that <strong>there are observable, scientific certainties</strong>; not <em>everything</em> is up for grabs and interpretation in the physical world.Even if our amazing human brains can think new things upâ€¦</p>
<p>Now don't get me wrongâ€¦ any scientist worth their salt will tell you that there is far more of the universe that we <strong>don't</strong> know about or understand than that we <strong>do</strong>. Like it ain't even close (some estimates put our actual understanding of just the extent of the <em>known physical universe</em> to be like 1%).*</p>
<p>But then again, even in cases where we don't know WHY something happens exactly (like gravity), we can count on that thing HAPPENING (like with gravity).</p>
<p>No matter your particular world view, I'd bet that you'd agree: there's a gap between observable, scientific realities (aka the 'evidence', or 'research', or 'scientific studies') and our actual understanding about WHY things are happening.</p>
<p>Extended into the human body, these gaps really come into focus, maybe because we have to also contend with our own subjective sense of ourselves.</p>
<p>We can observe certain changes over time, but at the same time know that by measuring and observing one thing (or a few things) we are <em>neccessarily</em> not seeing the whole organism (aka the PERSON). We can't it all in if we are focused on a few pieces.</p>
<p>So us trainersâ€”aka those (crazy?) people who believe that by <em>moving yourself</em> in certain, specific ways, you can actually change your physical reality by getting more coordinated, growing new tissue and expanding your endurance/capacityâ€”are choosing to face a funny challenge that is equal parts <em>science</em> and <em>magic.Or, Alchemy. </em>ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
<p>And the weirdest part? that's the best that any of us trainers (or PTs, Chiro's, massages therapists, mental health therapists, etc etc etc) we can doâ€”any of usâ€”to help you: <strong>we can help guide you</strong> (an unknowable WHOLE) <strong>based on the specific details we DO know about the world generally</strong> (aka the evidence, grounding, andâ€”hopefullyâ€”science). And, we can (try to) learn.</p>
<p>I'm curious â€¦ what does the word 'alchemy' bring up for you? Other than, ya know, <em>The Fitness Alchemists </em>ðŸ˜‰.</p>
<p>In your corner,
Coach Will</p>

<li>This is where the 'woo' factor comes in for me, and seems really useful and even important: we <em>all</em> need to contend with the <em>fact</em> that there are parts of the universe, our experience, <em>everything</em> really, that we do not and will not ever understand. I think this capacity to NOT know things, and be ok with it, is sometimes called 'the ability to tolerate ambiguity,' or <em>wisdom</em>. And the wide world of 'woo' happens to offer a cornucopia of pathways to engaging with this deeply ancestral knowledge (somethings that is also sometimes referred to as <em>wisdom</em>).</li>
