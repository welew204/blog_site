            <br />
            <p>Heyyyyy there,
 </p>
<p>Coach Will here, and I'm writing to you from the road—Colorado to be exact. And I keep pinching myself.
 </p>
<p>After more than a year of clinging tightly to my home, and my routines, as a sanctuary from Covid but also an anchor for this wild year, me and my girlfriend hit the road.
 </p>
<p>We left Oakland 5 days ago and shot like an arrow across the rippling dead heat of Nevada and through the endless red canyons of Utah.
 </p>
<p>Going a bit slower over the Rockies, in deference to elevation that made our car (and us) pant a bit, it struck me that the same sense of safety and sovereignty I had clung to in Oakland was still firmly within my grasp.
 </p>
<p>It feels different than all the other road trips I've ever taken, more free, more spontaneous, more loose but also more satisfying.
 </p>
<p>Because rather than just a way of getting between points by car, this time the <strong>journey</strong> truly feels like the point of the trip.
 </p>
<p>What a gift.
 </p>
<p>See, in the past when I've travelled, the slow pace involved in actually getting to the destination had to be mitigated (I thought) by a constant bustle of activity.
 </p>
<p>Could I sneak in a workout before or after driving for the day?</p>
<p>Could I piece together a 'healthy' meal from truck stop snacks?</p>
<p>Could I—somehow—take in all the attractions <em>and</em> stay on schedule?
 </p>
<p>In each scenario, could I manage to 'work toward my goals' <em>and</em> be present for whatever magic the road had to offer?
 </p>
<p>No.
 </p>
<p>I couldn't, though I tried, and tried, and tried…
 </p>
<p>It was always a let-down because (I realize now) <strong>I was trying to live two lives at once.</strong>
 </p>
<p>One life was the achiever, the habit-keeper, the version of myself that seemed most virtuous.</p>
<p>And the other was the traveler, the observer, the version of myself who could be at peace with myself—my body, my abilities, my trajectory—to be <em>changed</em> by the world around me<em>.</em>
 </p>
<p>And as I reflect on this tendency of mine, I realize that this is yet another manifestation of the message that we Fitness Alchemists push so adamantly: <strong>it is worth the labor to get into friendship with yourself, starting with your body.</strong>
 </p>
<p>Because <em>as you do </em>(for it's an on-going process, continuously unfolding), you begin to realize that everything you need—to feel safe, grounded, and ready for adventure—is right <em>here</em>, built right into your incredible biology.</p>
<p>So wherever you, and whatever you're up to this summer, I'll invite you—again and again—to <strong>befriend your body</strong>.</p>
<p>In your corner,</p>
<p>Coach Will</p>
