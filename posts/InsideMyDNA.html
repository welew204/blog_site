            <br />
            <p>Coach Will here, welcoming you to your Wednesday!</p>
<p>And I need to talk about why movement, fitness, (cue the voice of your worst PE coach memory) "exercise" is--after all is said and done--<em>pure magic</em> to me.</p>
<p>See, with the movement-DNA link recently in the news <strong>again</strong>, I found myself navel-gazing <strong>again</strong>. </p>
<p>That DNA is incredible 'innit*? Basically a tiny folded up building manual for your whole being, reproduced (almost) perfectly in every single one of your cells. For your whole life.</p>
<p>Look at your arm for a moment. Notice the layers apparent to you. </p>
<p>See your arm hair, and how it rises out of your skin. Notice any visible freckles, or spots, or veins. </p>
<p>And realize that beyond what you can see, you can <strong>feel</strong> much more--heat, pressure, stiffness, ache, firmness/softness of the various tissue. </p>
<p>But now squeeze your fist. </p>
<p>Notice how the tissue jolts into incredible, controlled action. Bones remain sturdy while layers of muscle and sinew slide seamlessly along each other, stretching skin in barely-detectable spirals of tension. </p>
<p>From a single, simple thought ("squeeze fist"), a coherent response (movement) seems to spontaneously <em>emerge</em>. </p>
<p>That dense tangle of tissue, so coherently but unconsciously organized, was <em>written by our DNA</em>. </p>
<p>But there's more. Like the NYTimes reported--but many others (actual coaches/teachers) have been talking about for a long time<em><em>--the intent to move, and therefore our reliance </em>on</em> movement, are also written into our DNA. </p>
<p>Finally, combine this with the old, trusty standby of any strength coach worth their iron--<strong>the SAID principle</strong> (which says that a Specific Adaptation is the result of the specific Imposed Demand--SAID)--and you have a breathtaking feedback loop. </p>
<p>An organic algorithm. </p>
<p>The combination of (1.) resilient, change-able tissue, (2.) a drive to move that tissue, and (3.) an observed principle that describes how movement changes that tissue creates a poised and balanced system: <strong>our body</strong>. </p>
<p>So the DNA recipe said something like this: Produce cells. Organize according to some basic rules. Start moving. </p>
<p><strong>And that's all</strong>, because the recipe could then assume that the <em>moving</em> does the magic of form-fitting us to our lives. Movement literally <em>forms</em> tissue into a specific use-purpose, based on the specific demands of that movement. After all, "Force is the language of our cells."***</p>
<p><strong>But without movement, we are left with a bunch of tissue that is missing some major guidance as to what it should become.</strong> Sure, elbow tissue is the stuff that grows from your elbow; but it only know <em>how</em> to be a part of your arm (and your life) if you teach it, inform it, apply force through it, which is all just to say: <strong>use it</strong>. </p>
<p>So look at your arm again. Look at it with an <em>internal lens</em>, combining your visual, sensational, and imaginary capacities to form a mental model of all the layers, and all the dimensions of scale (muscle, fiber, cell, nucleus, proteins, atoms…). </p>
<p>Observe your DNA. </p>
<p><strong>And realize that you can, and do, talk to it the very moment you begin to move.</strong></p>
<p>What do you want to say?</p>
<p>To your gold,</p>
<p>Coach Will</p>
