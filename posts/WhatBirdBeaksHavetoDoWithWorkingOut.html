            <h1>What Bird Beaks Have to Do With Working Out</h1>
<h3>Author: Will Belew</h3>
<h4>Thu, Feb 04 2021</h4>
<p>---&lt;<em>&gt;---
Hey, it‚Äôs Coach Will checking in on you as we enter‚Ä¶[scary voice]  February. I have a quick story for you I just learned about, and it might just shift how you see ‚Äòtraining‚Äô your body‚Ä¶I‚Äôd love to hear what you think: In 1973, a couple British scientists (who happened to be married) landed on Daphne Major, one of the small volcanic islands that make up the Galapagos Archipelago. Peter and Rosemary Grant were there to camp out and take on-going measurements of the finches that call Daphne Major home, as part of larger research questions about natural selection. The island offered some special advantages--isolation, mostly--which also made the work a true labor of commitment, even for just that first 6 month stint. I say  just  because they kept-- keep-- coming back for 40+ years. 40 years of measuring birds. From the sounds of it though, these two couldn‚Äôt be happier about their situation, perhaps because those measurements have provided some of the most important evidence of how evolution  actually  works,  in real-time. Ok, so pausing the low-key biology class for a sec‚Ä¶  somehow, these two were able to stay focused on a long-term  question , day in and day out, for 4 decades . In a very tangible way, their deep curiosity was sufficient to guide and energize their way, to give them the drive to fill  thousands  of water-proof notebooks with precise measurements of population size, feeding habits, bodies, and beaks.  There are  so  many parallels to fitness and training that I kept yelping while reading about them</em>*, much to my girlfriend‚Äôs annoyance üòè‚Ä¶ Like, how the Grants literally  did not know  what they would discover, even while they knew they‚Äôd have to be there for at least a decade to get even a scrap of insight. They were satisfied with merely asking big, interesting questions.  What if we embarked on the project of training our bodies with even a fraction of this perspective? What if instead of  goals  we were powered by  questions ? Or, how intimately the Grants came to know the finch populations. In addition to creating powerful statistical models that helped them see how the populations were changing over time (ie big picture info), Peter apparently could identify every individual bird  by site  most seasons (600 - 1000+ individuals ü§Ø...that‚Äôs some serious detail). What would knowing  ourselves  (with that type of high and low-level) clarity mean for our relationship with our bodies? What kind of  body wisdom  would we find intuitively, by feel, with no need for outside experts? Now I‚Äôm not proposing that we all go out and buy those hyper-accurate calipers and start measuring our beaks (üê¶). No, we‚Äôre lucky to have a tool that‚Äôs much better-suited to knowing ourselves, physically:  CARs (aka Controlled Articular Rotations) . Complete with a nerdy-sounding name, these movements offer a way of scientifically researching  ourselves , and the results can be  profound , especially if we stick with it for a few weeks, months, or <gasp> decades. The thing is, CARs give us that intimate detail  and  that big-picture view of how things change. They help us answer the important questions. And as a bonus, a full body set (about 10mins) makes just about the best daily physical routine we can think of‚Ä¶. So good in fact that we made a  follow-along video that you can watch  (for free) on YouTube, because we think they‚Äôre just that important/cool. (There‚Äôs a bunch more free-free on our channel right now, too!) Here‚Äôs to finding your gold (even in February üòâ), Coach Will PS: If you check out the CARs routine, like it, and want more of this kind of thing, hit that ‚ÄòSubscribe‚Äô button...it helps us know that this is a useful channel for our peeps (aka  you )! ** I read about the Grants and all the ways that their findings have impacted our view of the world in Justin Wiener‚Äôs excellent book, called  The Beak of the Finch ‚Üí BIG recommend  if you like dense (but highly readable) non-fiction  üëå</p>
