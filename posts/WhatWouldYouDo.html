            <br />
            <p>One of my all-time favorite nerd-tastic words is 'affordance'.</p>
<p>According to trusty wikipedia, 'affordances are what the environment offers the individual'.</p>
<p>It's such a great way of describing the profound ways that we compliment our environment, being shaped by our surroundings even as <em>we</em> shape those very surroundings.</p>
<p>An affordance is that window ledge that offers you the perfect lookout perch, that 5-gallon bucket that, when flipped over, transforms into a perfect drum, and also that pesky crack in the sidewalk that you subconsciously change stride to accommodate.</p>
<p>Great designers think about the way that products 'afford' their users certain possibilities, as do urban planners, architects, and sports scientists.</p>
<p>In each realm, the fact that humans use direct awareness of environmental cues to shape their understanding of the world--and their unique possibilities within that world--means that if you can change someone's environment, even subtly, you can definitively change their life.</p>
<p>ðŸ¤¯</p>
<p>As a fitness coach, focused on how to impact the <em>internal</em> environment of bodies, I also see this interaction between a person and their environment at play when they access MOAR movement options (by expanding the usable range of motion of their joints).</p>
<p>Suddenly, that too-high-to-reach-shelf is not so high when your shoulder allows your arm bones to go alllllll the way behind your ear.</p>
<p>Suddenly that low cupboard where you keep your big stock pot is not a job for hands-and-knees, not when you have a hip that allows you to squat or lunge down to grab it.</p>
<p>Suddenly that too-steep-for-my-knees bike ride is not just doable but down right exhilarating (that's what's going on in the pic above--photo cred to the inimitable @true_spokes )</p>
<p>Of course, this 'sudden' re-orientation within our environments is not necessarily quick--the work of changing our tissues to accommodate more stable movement is substantial, and takes persistence.</p>
<p>But the pay-off can be life-changing.</p>
<p>How would your world change if your joints afforded you even 5% more access to <em>your</em> movement dreams?</p>
