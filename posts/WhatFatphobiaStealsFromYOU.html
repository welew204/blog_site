            <h2>What Fatphobia Steals From YOU</h2>
            <h3>Will Belew</h3>

            <br />
            <p>Hey friend,</p>
<p>As I am learning, the fight against fatphobia and diet culture is many things, but one of the most critical pieces is realizing that 'losing weight' or 'getting thinner' (or really any body-shaping intent) is <strong>not worth settling for</strong> as a driver for getting movement into your life.</p>
<p>The way our bodies gain or lose weight are like the tides, coming in and out due to complex intersections of context, circumstance, genetics, and life experience.</p>
<p>But--and this is key--<strong>it's not about morality</strong>.</p>
<p>Your worth as a person is simply not related to the size of your body. Period.</p>
<p>And since there's nothing separating good people from bad based on their body shape, spending your life (and your savings) on trying to change it into a particular version that matches more closely the kind of body everyone sees on TV is quite simply … not worth it.</p>
<p>Instead, you could spend your energy on:</p>
<p>climbing mountains</p>
<p>seeking out new physical sensations (of strength, pleasure, relaxation, etc)</p>
<p>foraging for or cooking tasty food</p>
<p>building furniture</p>
<p>racing bikes, or pigeons</p>
<p>whatever the HECK you want</p>
<p>See I believe that everyone has their own particular 'raison to move', and that it takes <em>patience and sensitivity</em> to figure it out what it is, for <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>And as you do (and it <em>is</em> a process of uncovering), alll the pieces fit: you find <strong>joy</strong> <strong>and motivation</strong> in simply <em>doing the thing</em>, you find <strong>connection and meaning with other people</strong> who connect with that same physical practice, and your <strong>health</strong> (also an individual, special blend for each person) magically improves.</p>
<p>Hell, maybe even your body changes shape, but at this point <em>you don't care</em>. You care much more about how you can work <em>with </em>your body to move in <em>your </em>special way than how you can simply alter how it looks. </p>
<p>And ... you'll likely still have days you feel shitty about your body (<em>we all do </em>), about how you look, how you feel, how capable you perceive yourself to be...</p>
<p>But overshadowing alllll of that, overwhelming you with gratitude about how magical your body is, will be those lovely movement experiences that scratch YOUR particular itch to <strong>get moving</strong>.</p>
<p>Now here's the rub: you won't ever realize that special intersection of <strong>experience, movement, and emotion</strong> until you set down the tired (and <em>baseless</em>, and <em>unscientific</em>, and <em>costly</em>) code that says we all need to look like a magazine cover.</p>
<p>Cuz we all need something much, much more important than that; we need our own, personal reason to move.</p>
<p>So…what moves you?</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>PS: If you're curious about how you could actually <em>work on </em>uncovering your own movement motivation <em>outside of the diet culture paradigm</em>, do me a favor and let me know by replying to this email, k? I'm thinking about running a 5-ish week (online) program specifically focused on this topic in the fall, and would love to know if you'd like to be part of it.</p>
