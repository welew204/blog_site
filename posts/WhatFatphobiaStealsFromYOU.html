            <h1>What Fatphobia Steals From YOU</h1>
<h3>Author: Will Belew</h3>
<h4>Tue, Aug 03 2021</h4>
<p>---&lt;<em>&gt;---
Hey friend, As I am learning, the fight against fatphobia and  diet culture  is many things, but one of the most critical pieces is realizing that 'losing weight' or 'getting thinner' (or really any body-shaping intent) is  not  worth  settling for  as a driver for getting movement into your life. The way our bodies gain or lose weight are like the tides, coming in and out due to complex intersections of context, circumstance, genetics, and life experience. But--and this is key-- it’s not about  morality . Your worth as a person is simply not related to the size of your body. Period. And since there’s nothing separating good people from bad based on their body shape, spending your life (and your savings) on trying to change it into a particular version that matches more closely the kind of body everyone sees on TV is quite simply … not worth it. Instead, you could spend your energy on: climbing mountains seeking out new physical sensations (of strength, pleasure, relaxation, etc) foraging for or cooking tasty food building furniture racing bikes, or pigeons whatever the HECK you want See I believe that everyone has their own particular ‘raison to move’, and that it takes  patience and sensitivity  to figure it out what it is, for </em>you*. And as you do (and it  is  a process of uncovering), alll the pieces fit: you find  joy   and motivation  in simply  doing the thing , you find  connection and meaning with other people  who connect with that same physical practice, and your  health  (also an individual, special blend for each person) magically improves. Hell, maybe even your body changes shape, but at this point  you don’t care . You care much more about how you can work  with  your body to move in  your  special way than how you can simply alter how it looks.  And ... you’ll likely still have days you feel shitty about your body ( we all do  ), about how you look, how you feel, how capable you perceive yourself to be... But overshadowing alllll of that, overwhelming you with gratitude about how magical your body is, will be those lovely movement experiences that scratch YOUR particular itch to  get moving . Now here's the rub: you won’t ever realize that special intersection of  experience, movement, and emotion  until you set down the tired (and  baseless , and  unscientific , and  costly ) code that says we all need to look like a magazine cover. Cuz we all need something much, much more important than that; we need our own, personal reason to move. So…what moves you? - Coach Will PS: If you're curious about how you could actually  work on  uncovering your own movement motivation  outside of the diet culture paradigm , do me a favor and let me know by replying to this email, k? I'm thinking about running a 5-ish week (online) program specifically focused on this topic in the fall, and would love to know if you'd like to be part of it.</p>
